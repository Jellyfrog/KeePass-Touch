        <h1>Sync files with Dropbox</h1>
        
        <p>KeePass database files located on Dropbox can be synced to or from KeePass Touch using the Dropbox Integration.<br/>
        Please notice: A .key-File can not be synced for your own safety. Please use a local sync way to get it onto your device, e.g. local WiFi Sync or iTunes Sync.
        </p>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Sync Menu by pressing the (2nd left) button on the bottom bar</li>
            <li>Choose Dropbox Sync</li>
            <li>Login with your Dropbox Login.</li>
            <li>Repeat Steps 1 and 2.</li>
            <li>Choose the Folder you wanna sync with</li>
            <li>Hit "Done" on the top right."</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h1>Auto Sync</h1>
        <p>
        After you choose Dropbox Sync you will be asked if you want to activate Auto Sync. If you do so, the app will launch and compare the current version
        of your Keepass Database with your Dropbox Version and automatically use the most recent version of your database.
        We recommend this feature if you are using Dropbox to keep your Database in sync!
