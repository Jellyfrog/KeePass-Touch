        <h1>Touch ID</h1>
        
        <p>If your device supports Touch ID KeePass Touch can lock/unlock your database with it.<br/>
        To do that follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to settings via the button on the bottom left</li>
            <li>Change the "Touch ID"-Switch to on.</li>
            <li>Go back to the database selection.</li>
            <li>Put in your password for the last time.</li>
            <li>Next time you open it, you will be prompted for your fingerprint for identification and your database unlocks.</li>
            
        </ol>
        <p>
        To turn Touch ID off, just visit the settings again and change the switch back off.
